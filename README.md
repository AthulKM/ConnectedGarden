ESAIP will acquire a connected garden which will be in the patio of the new building C. We would like to have an application to follow the watering of the plants.

Figure 1 – connected garden


The goal of this project is to make a model of a Web application for the management of this connected garden. The garden will be divided into zones, each having the following characteristics :
— an identification number,
— a content (a simple character string), — a watering duration in minutes,
— and a frequency expressed in days.


The features we would like in this irrigation management application are as follows :
1. view all zones by number,
2. display for each zone the type of plant it contains, the duration and the frequency watering, 3. add a type of plant in an area specifying the duration and frequency watering,
4. modify one of the characteristics of an area,
5. delete the contents of an area.
You must implement all of these features, but you are free to add any new functionality that you will find useful.

1 Project objective
Through this project, students in the Digital Bachelor will apply the basics theoretical and practical acquired during the various courses. They perform in groups of 3 or 4 students maximum, a technical project supervised by the school’s teacher-researchers.
The projects concern the resolution of a technical problem (development, networks, bases of data, etc) by a formalized methodology. These projects constitute a concrete experience group work and the use of project management tools. Students must demonstrate of the realization of the project their capacity to integrate the various teachings received in particular in project management.

2 The work consists of the following different phases :
— the drafting of specifications,
— the phase of analysis and drafting of specifications and design files, — the realization phase,
— and the test phase.
Modalities and progress of the project
The project takes place in the second semester of the first year’s training and is spread over ten weeks. All sessions are scheduled ; some are framed, and the others project sessions are autonomous.

3 The groups will be trinomials or pairs depending on the number of students.
Deliverables
The following phases will be the subject of a written report : — the specifications,
— the spec file,
— the design folder,
— the test folder.
A final report including all the parts will be delivered at the end of the project before the presentation.

4 Coding
The project will not be developed in its entirety. The language used is the C language.

5 Presentation
The project must be presented by the team in front of a jury composed of at least one supervisor accompanied by a non-expert person. The presence of a non-expert makes it possible to measure the students’ ability to present their work to a non-technically informed audience.
The duration of the presentation will be 20 minutes followed by 5 minutes of demonstration of the project and 10 minutes of questions. A 5-minute restitution will be made at the end of the deliberation of the jury. The oral presentation is open to all students in the group, except for the restitution.
